## Data Team Motivation

- Studies feature multiple kinds of data (surveys, activity trackers, etc.)
- Varying degree of data trustworthiness and cleanliness
- Previously no 3EA-specific standards for data management

---
class: middle

## Why R?

- Needed flexible language to address data problems
- Easy to use

--

- Mayarí started the team, and she knew R so... here we are lol

# Basic R Setup

---

## Installation

- [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [Install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

We need to install both, unlike STATA for example, since R does not provide an _integrated development environment_ (IDE). That's where RStudio comes in.

---

## Packages

Packages collections of code that extend base R's functionality.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1572)

installed.packages() %>% 
  tibble::as_tibble() %>% 
  dplyr::select(Package, Version) %>% 
  dplyr::slice_sample(n = 9)
```

---

## Packages

Let's install some popular and handy packages. Open RStudio, and run these lines in the "Console" tab: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("tidymodels")
```

You only need to run these **once**. Once you have them installed, you don't need to keep re-installing them (_I see this often in R analysis scripts!!_).

# Let's use R!

## 🖥

---

# Attaching Packages

The first step in an R script is to **attach your desired packages**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

---

# Attaching Packages

```{r}
# This is part of the "tidymodels" meta-package
library(modeldata)
```

---

# Attaching Packages

Attaching a package with `library()` loads all of its **functions** into your environment:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
this_is_a_function(some_input, another_input)
```

If you *don't* attach a package, you'll have to refer to its functions using `::`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
packagename::this_is_a_function(some_input, another_input)
```

---
class: middle

We're going to use the `ames` dataset from {modeldata}.

```{r}
data(ames, package = "modeldata")
```

`ames` is a running log of houses built in [Ames, IA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames%2C_Iowa) since 1872. It's a good dataset for teaching.

---

Let's take a look at the data. We'll use `str()` which examines the **str**ucture of any R object.

```{r}
str(ames)
```

---

Let's select the first few columns and get their summaries.

```{r}
ames %>% 
  select(Lot_Frontage:Lot_Config) %>% 
  summary()
```

`select()` is from the {dplyr} package, a popular tool for data manipulation.

## _A Brief Aside_

### What the heck is

# `%>%`

### ???

---

.center[ 
# %>% 
## This is a _pipe_.
]

The _pipe_ is a tool that allows people to _chain functions together_. Rather than writing

```{r, eval=FALSE}
h(g(f(x)))
```

we can write

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x %>% 
  f() %>% 
  g() %>% 
  h()
```

The pipe is provided by the **{magrittr}** package (and re-exported by members of tidyverse). It works by inserting the _output_ of the previous function into the _first_ argument of the next.

---

### This means

```{r, eval=FALSE}
step1 <- first_step(input)
step2 <- second_step(step1, run_task = TRUE)
third_step(step2, with_marmalade = FALSE)
```

### is functionally equivalent to

```{r, eval=FALSE}
input %>% 
  first_step() %>% 
  second_step(run_task = TRUE) %>% 
  third_step(with_marmalade = FALSE)
```

We have all of this housing data. Let's explore it a bit.

--

Why not take a look at historical trends?

--

The package **{ggplot2}** gives us a handy toolkit for visualization based on the Grammar of Graphics (basic overview [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-grammar-of-graphics-for-effective-visualization-of-multi-dimensional-1f92b4ed4149)).

---

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.height=7, message=FALSE}
ames %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year_Built)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

---

# A Sincere Apology

See this:

```r
ames %>% 
* ggplot(aes(x = Year_Built)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

--

This is how **{ggplot2}** does function chaining. The choice of **`+`** was done prior to `%>%` existing.

--

The author, **Hadley Wickham**, decided that "adding" layers would make intuitive sense (it does).

--

Sadly, it doesn't generalize. So, we have this `+` and `%>%` combination. And for that I apologize.

---

## Just remember...

--

.center[
### `+`

for {ggplot2} functions
]

--

.center[
### `%>%`

for everything else.
]

--

.center[
# OK 😁
]

---

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.height=7, message=FALSE}
ames %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year_Built)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

---
class: middle

## How does the sale price relate to the construction year?

---

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.height=7, message=FALSE}
ames %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year_Built, y = Sale_Price)) +
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method = "loess")
```

---
class: middle

### Looks like the prices started to rise after the 1940s.

## Could the inclusion of air conditioning have anything to do with it?

---

Firstly, let's put the sale price on log units.

```{r}
ames_edited <- 
  ames %>% 
  mutate(log_sale_price = log10(Sale_Price))
```

`mutate()` is another {dplyr} function that creates or modifies variables in a dataset. In this case, I'm creating the variable `log_sale_price` to exist in the newly created `ames_edited` dataset.

--

_Yes, you can have multiple datasets open at once!_

--

The `<-` symbol is the _assignment operator_ in R. It assigns the value of the right-hand side to a variable _symbol_ on the left-hand side.

---

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.height=7, message=FALSE}
ames_edited %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year_Built, y = log_sale_price, color = Central_Air)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```

---
class: middle

### It's a little hard to tease out with that visualization, but it looks to have some form of effect.

## Let's split the plots to see better...

---

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.height=6.5, message=FALSE}
ames_edited %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year_Built, y = log_sale_price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~ Central_Air)
```

---

### It definitely seems to influence the sale price to some degree. 

### Let's run ANOVA to get some statistical insight. 

### But this time let's do this in a more streamlined and scalable manner...

---
class: middle

```{r}
# No Central_Air covariate
mod_1 <- log_sale_price ~ Year_Built

# Inclusion of Central_Air, but no interaction with Year_Built 
mod_2 <- log_sale_price ~ Year_Built + Central_Air

# Inclusion of Central_Air with interaction
mod_3 <- log_sale_price ~ Year_Built * Central_Air 

splat <- function(.x, .f) {
  do.call(.f, .x)
}

mod_anova <- 
  # Collect all models together
  list(mod_1, mod_2, mod_3) %>% 
  
  # For each model, run a linear model fit with ames_edited
  map(function(.x) lm(.x, data = ames_edited)) %>% 
  
  # "Splat" the results into anova: 
  # Converts splat(x, f) --> f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
  splat(anova)
```

.center[
## 😲🤨
]

---

We'll use the **{broom}** package from tidymodels to collect the summary statistics into a consistent format. There are **_many_** modeling packages out there, and not all of them have consistent output. broom solves this problem for _most_ common modeling tools.

```{r}
library(broom)
```

--

```{r}
tidy(mod_anova)
```

---

# Summary

- Has a great ecosystem of tools for data manipulation and visualization.
- Has an *impressively large* selection of modeling tools<sup>1</sup>, and {broom} deals with _tidying_ the model outputs into a consistent format.
- Is _extremely versatile_ because of its **functional language** style.
- Has a very friendly community, many of whom are in NYC!

# So how does the Data Team use R?

# 🤔

---

# The Data Team are _engineers_

We don't perform analyses<sup>1</sup>. We make sure the data used for analysis is as trustworthy as possible.

--

## As such, we emphasize data documentation and lineage

We build tools and automated pipelines to speed up the data cleaning process while still retaining necessary information about how the data were transformed to maximize transparency.

.footnote[
[1]: We have an ongoing modeling project to detect record mislinkage to make verification less manually intensive.
