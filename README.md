This is the repository containing an internal(-ish) slideshow about the
Data Team at [NYU Global TIES](https://github.com/nyuglobalties) and how
it uses R.

## Installation

If youâ€™d like to play around with the materials here, do these tasks:

1.  `git clone` this repo into your folder of choice (you can also use
    the `Code > Download ZIP...` button).
2.  Open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
3.  Run these commands in the console:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# If you haven't already installed it,
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)
```

That should install all of the packages needed to build this
presentation.
