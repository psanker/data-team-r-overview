This is the repository containing an internal(-ish) slideshow about the
Data Team at [NYU Global TIES](https://github.com/nyuglobalties) and how
it uses R.

## Installation

If you’d like to play around with the materials here, do these tasks:

1.  `git clone` this repo into your folder of choice (you can also use
    the `Code > Download ZIP...` button).
2.  Open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
3.  Run this command in the console:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
source("install.R")
```

That should install all of the packages needed to build this
presentation and run the example drake workflow.

Note: it may yell at you about a “GitHub personal access token”. See
[this blurb in *Happy Git with
R*](https://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html#step-by-step) for more
information and context.
