This is the repository containing an internal(-ish) slideshow about the Data Team at [NYU Global TIES](https://github.com/nyuglobalties) and how it uses R.

## Installation

If you'd like to play around with the materials here, do these tasks: 

1. `git clone` this repo into your folder of choice (you can also use the `Code > Download ZIP...` button). 
1. Open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
1. Run this command in the console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("install.R")
```

That should install all of the packages needed to build this presentation and run the example drake workflow.

Note: it may yell at you about a "GitHub personal access token". See [this blurb in _Happy Git with R_](https://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html#step-by-step) for more information and context.
