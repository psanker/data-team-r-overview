This is the repository containing an internal(-ish) slideshow about the Data Team at [NYU Global TIES](https://github.com/nyuglobalties) and how it uses R.

## Installation

If you'd like to play around with the materials here, do these tasks: 

1. `git clone` this repo into your folder of choice (you can also use the `Code > Download ZIP...` button). 
1. Open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
1. Run these commands in the console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# If you haven't already installed it,
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)
```

That should install all of the packages needed to build this presentation.
